## Contributing

Before contributing code, you must present a use case and an API for the component.  No components or code will be considered unless they have first been throughly discussed with an API in mind.  Please make a PR with said component blueprints and they must be cleared by the team first before development work should be started.

Once an API has been cleared, it must be added with the appropriate docs, tests and relevant source code in a PR.
