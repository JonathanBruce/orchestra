Contibuting code to Orchestra requires that a design exist for it.  These designs are usually done by Insightpool's UI designer for the use cases we need.  Once that's complete, you must present an API with how it will work.  This can be done by making a PR to the docs with said component explanation.  No component will be considered unless it's been thoroughly discussed and has underlying documentation.

Once an API has been cleared relevant source code and tests can be added in a PR.  Component must be functionally tested before being merged.
